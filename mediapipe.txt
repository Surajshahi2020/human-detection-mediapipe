MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google for building cross-platform applied machine learning (ML) pipelines. It’s designed to facilitate the development of various real-time computer vision and machine learning applications, especially those related to multimedia processing.

Some common features and uses of MediaPipe include:
1)Face Detection and Recognition – MediaPipe offers pre-trained models for detecting faces and facial landmarks.
2)Hand Tracking – It includes robust hand tracking capabilities to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
3)Pose Estimation – It can detect the body pose, tracking key body points for activities like fitness or gesture recognition.
4)Object Detection – MediaPipe can also be used for detecting objects, including detecting human presence in video feeds.
5)Video Processing – It is highly optimized for video stream processing with real-time performance.
